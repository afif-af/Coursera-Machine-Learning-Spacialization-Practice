In notation, vectors are denoted with lower case bold letters such as $\\mathbf{x}$.  The elements of a vector are all the same type. A vector does not, for example, contain both characters and numbers. The number of elements in the array is often referred to as the *dimension* though mathematicians may prefer *rank*. The vector shown has a dimension of $n$. The elements of a vector can be referenced with an index. In math settings, indexes typically run from 1 to n. In computer science and these labs, indexing will typically run from 0 to n-1.  In notation, elements of a vector, when referenced individually will indicate the index in a subscript, for example, the $0^{th}$ element, of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is $x_0$. Note, the x is not bold in this case.  \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5d168e12","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007976,"end_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:02.062332","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:02.054356","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<a name=\"toc_40015_3.3\"></a>\n","## 3.3 Vector Creation\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8c55ac0d","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006865,"end_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:02.075901","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:02.069036","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Data creation routines in NumPy will generally have a first parameter which is the shape of the object.

Here is why:\n","- Going forward, our examples will be stored in an array, `X_train` of dimension (m,n). This will be explained more in context, but here it is important to note it is a 2 Dimensional array or matrix (see next section on matrices).\n","- `w` will be a 1-dimensional vector of shape (n,).\n","- we will perform operations by looping through the examples, extracting each example to work on individually by indexing X. For example:`X[i]`\n","- `X[i]` returns a value of shape (n,), a 1-dimensional vector. Consequently, operations involving `X[i]` are often vector-vector.  \n","\n","That is a somewhat lengthy explanation, but aligning and understanding the shapes of your operands is important when performing vector operations."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"id":"79a9a3f1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.253577Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.253019Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.260898Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.259346Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.019049,"end_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.263143","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.244094","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["X[1] has shape (1,)\n","w has shape (1,)\n","c has shape ()\n"]}],"source":["# show common Course 1 example\n","X = np.array([[1],[2],[3],[4]])\n","w = np.array([2])\n","c = np.dot(X[1], w)\n","\n","print(f\"X[1] has shape {X[1].shape}\")\n","print(f\"w has shape {w.shape}\")\n","print(f\"c has shape {c.shape}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c1e63d62","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007273,"end_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.278268","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.270995","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<a name=\"toc_40015_4.1\"></a>\n","## 4.1 Abstract\n","Matrices, are two dimensional arrays. The elements of a matrix are all of the same type. In notation, matrices are denoted with capitol, bold letter such as $\\mathbf{X}$. In this and other labs, `m` is often the number of rows and `n` the number of columns. The elements of a matrix can be referenced with a two dimensional index. In math settings, numbers in the index typically run from 1 to n. In computer science and these labs, indexing will run from 0 to n-1.  \n","<figure>\n","    <center> <img src=\"./images/C1_W2_Lab04_Matrices.PNG\"  alt='missing'  width=900><center/>\n","    <figcaption> Generic Matrix Notation, 1st index is row, 2nd is column </figcaption>\n","<figure/>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"id":"c0c7b9e3","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.296027Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.294965Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.302851Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.301638Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.01973,"end_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.305638","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.285908","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["a shape = (1, 5), a = [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n","a shape = (2, 1), a = [[0.]\n"," [0.]]\n","a shape = (1, 1), a = [[0.44236513]]\n"]}],"source":["a = np.zeros((1, 5))                                       \n","print(f\"a shape = {a.shape}, a = {a}\")                     \n","\n","a = np.zeros((2, 1))                                                                   \n","print(f\"a shape = {a.shape}, a = {a}\") \n","\n","a = np.random.random_sample((1, 1))  \n","print(f\"a shape = {a.shape}, a = {a}\") "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"id":"d6fa4fce","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.323137Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.322705Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.329596Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.328448Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.018818,"end_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.332498","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.31368","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":[" a shape = (3, 1), np.array: a = [[5]\n"," [4]\n"," [3]]\n"," a shape = (3, 1), np.array: a = [[5]\n"," [4]\n"," [3]]\n"]}],"source":["# NumPy routines which allocate memory and fill with user specified values\n","a = np.array([[5], [4], [3]]);   print(f\" a shape = {a.shape}, np.array: a = {a}\")\n","a = np.array([[5],   # One can also\n","              [4],   # separate values\n","              [3]]); #into separate rows\n","print(f\" a shape = {a.shape}, np.array: a = {a}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"id":"1abd6f06","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.35234Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.351733Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.359131Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.357986Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.020481,"end_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.362236","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.341755","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["a.shape: (3, 2), \n","a= [[0 1]\n"," [2 3]\n"," [4 5]]\n","\n","a[2,0].shape:   (), a[2,0] = 4,     type(a[2,0]) = <class 'numpy.int64'> Accessing an element returns a scalar\n","\n","a[2].shape:   (2,), a[2]   = [4 5], type(a[2])   = <class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n"]}],"source":["#vector indexing operations on matrices\n","a = np.arange(6).reshape(-1, 2)   #reshape is a convenient way to create matrices\n","print(f\"a.shape: {a.shape}, \\na= {a}\")\n","\n","#access an element\n","print(f\"\\na[2,0].shape:   {a[2, 0].shape}, a[2,0] = {a[2, 0]},     type(a[2,0]) = {type(a[2, 0])} Accessing an element returns a scalar\\n\")\n","\n","#access a row\n","print(f\"a[2].shape:   {a[2].shape}, a[2]   = {a[2]}, type(a[2])   = {type(a[2])}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"afcb9f99","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008818,"end_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.379562","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-22T11:17:06.370744","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["**Reshape**  \n","The previous example used [reshape](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html) to shape the array.  \n","`a = np.arange(6).reshape(-1, 2) `   \n","This line of code first created a *1-D Vector* of six elements.
